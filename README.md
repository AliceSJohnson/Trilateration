Trilateration 

The purposes of this project are,

1. Experiment cross platform development, using CMake and Ant.

2. Implement simple locating algorithm by using Trilateration.
   *Trilateration on a 2D plane, given 3 or more than 3 points and the distances from each point to the location you want to locate, then calculate its coordinates.
   *Trilateration in a 3D space, given 4 or more than 4 points and the distances from each point to the location you want to locate, then calculate its coordinates.

Trilateration 

The purposes of this project are,

1. Experiment cross platform development, using CMake and Ant.
   
   Basic usage: (support on windows and mac platform now. )

   Windows platform
   * Preparation projects: .\antwin.bat prep
   * Build projects: .\antwin.bat build
   * Delete builds: .\antwin.bat delete_build

   Mac platform
   * Preparation projects: ./antmac.sh prep
   * Build projects: ./antmac.sh build
   * Delete builds: ./antmac.sh delete_build

2. Implement simple locating algorithm by using Trilateration.

   *Trilateration on a 2D plane, given 3 or more than 3 points and the distances from each point to the location you want to locate, then calculate its coordinates.
   
   *Trilateration in a 3D space, given 4 or more than 4 points and the distances from each point to the location you want to locate, then calculate its coordinates.
